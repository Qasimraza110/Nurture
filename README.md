# Nurture
This website is a modern, responsive frontend UI built using React, Tailwind CSS, and React Hook Form. It is designed as an e-commerce platform for plant and flower products, providing users with a smooth and interactive shopping experience.

Key Features:

React is used for building reusable, component-based UI, ensuring fast and dynamic page updates.
Tailwind CSS provides utility-first, mobile-friendly styling, making the site visually appealing and fully responsive on all devices.
React Hook Form is used for efficient and user-friendly form handling, including login and registration forms with validation and error messages.
Product Listing: Users can browse featured products and categories, each with images, ratings, prices, and an "Add to Cart" button.
Cart Page: Users can view their selected products, update quantities, remove items, and see a real-time calculation of subtotal, tax, and total. The "Proceed to Pay" button is animated for better user engagement.
Animations: Subtle animations (like fade-in, slide-in, and button bounce) enhance the user experience.
Clean UI: The design is clean, modern, and easy to navigate, making it beginner-friendly for both users and developers.
This project is focused on frontend only and can be easily extended or connected to a backend for full e-commerce functionality
